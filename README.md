# CLI console app to work with NFT Wallet

Data structures that I have used are strictly linked for the Task. My solution is focused on the ability to efficiently execute 3 types of tasks:
- Persist information about ownership relationshop between imaginary NFT token ids and NFT wallet addresses provided in the task
- Quickly answer what wallet contains a token, by token Id. 
- Quickly answer what tokens are owned by certain wallet.
- Efficiently change the ownership of the Token between the wallet addresses.

I also tried to create the solution to fit the tight deadlines.

There are also a few things I skip and maybe return to it later. For example, if we need data integrity validation, I would probably go with some other ideas (like Merkle Trees used in the industry).

# Prerequisites

To build the solution you need to have .NET Core 6.0 SDK installed.

To open and review the source code it's best to have:
- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET Core 6.0

# How to run

## Windows

>dotnet build
>dotnet run

The application will show you a general help how to use it and list the available commands (see below in this instruction).

# Commands

>Illuvium.Nft.App --help

# How it works (Example)

There is transactions.json comes as an example file with list of transactions to quickly resume the state (for testing). Execute following commands:

>Illuvium.Nft.App --read-file transactions.json 
Read 5 transaction(s) 

>Illuvium.Nft.App --nft 0xA000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Token 0xA000000000000000000000000000000000000000 is not owned by any wallet 

>Illuvium.Nft.App --nft 0xB000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Token 0xA000000000000000000000000000000000000000 is owned by 0x3000000000000000000000000000000000000000 

>Illuvium.Nft.App --nft 0xC000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Token 0xC000000000000000000000000000000000000000 is owned by 0x3000000000000000000000000000000000000000 

>Illuvium.Nft.App --nft 0xD000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Token 0xA000000000000000000000000000000000000000 is not owned by any wallet 

>Illuvium.Nft.App --read-inline  "{ \"Type\": \"Mint\", \"TokenId\": \"0xD000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", \"Address\": \"0x1000000000000000000000000000000000000000\" }"
Read 1 transaction(s) 

>Illuvium.Nft.App --nft 0xD000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Token 0xA000000000000000000000000000000000000000 is owned by 0x1000000000000000000000000000000000000000 

>Illuvium.Nft.App --wallet 0x3000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Wallet 0x3000000000000000000000000000000000000000 holds 2 Tokens: 
0xB000000000000000000000000000000000000000 
0xC000000000000000000000000000000000000000 

>Illuvium.Nft.App -â€”reset
